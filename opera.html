            Won't it be a pretty wedding?<br>
                Will not Lisa look delightful?<br>
            Smiles and tears in plenty shedding—<br>
                Which in brides of course is rightful<br>
                One could say, if one were spiteful,<br>
            Contradiction little dreading,<br>
                Her bouquet is simply frightful—<br>
            Still, 'twill be a pretty wedding!<br>
            Oh, it is a pretty wedding!<br>
                Such a pretty, pretty wedding!
            <h5>ELSA.</h5>      
            If her dress is badly fitting,<br>
            Theirs the fault who made her trousseau.<br>
            <h5>BERTHA.</h5>
            If her gloves are always splitting,<br>
            Cheap kid gloves, we know, will do so.<br>
            <h5>OLGA.</h5>
            If upon her train she stumbled,<br>
            On one's train one's always treading.<br>
            <h5>GRET.</h5>
            If her hair is rather tumbled,<br>
            Still, 'twill be a pretty wedding!<br>
            <h5>CHORUS.</h5>
            Such a pretty, pretty wedding!<br>
            <h5>CHORUS.</h5>
            Here they come, the couple plighted—<br>
            On life's journey gaily start them.<br>
            Soon to be for aye united,<br>
            Till divorce or death shall part them.<br>
            <p style="color:red">(LUDWIG and LISA come forward.)</p><br>
            DUET—LUDWIG and LISA.<br>
            <h5>LUD.</h5>
            Pretty Lisa, fair and tasty,<br>
            Tell me now, and tell me truly,<br>
            Haven't you been rather hasty?<br>
            Haven't you been rash unduly?<br>
            Am I quite the dashing sposo<br>
            That your fancy could depict you?<br>
            Perhaps you think I'm only so-so?<br>
            (She expresses admiration.)<br>
            Well, I will not contradict you!<br>
            <h5>CHORUS.</h5>
            No, he will not contradict you!<br>
