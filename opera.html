        <h3>GRAND DUKE</h3>
        <h5>ACT I.—Scene. Public Square of Speisesaal</h5>
        <p style="color:green">
            SCENE.—Market-place of Speisesaal, in the Grand Duchy of Pfennig
            Halbpfennig.  A well, with decorated ironwork, up L.C. GRETCHEN,
            BERTHA, OLGA, MARTHA, and other members of ERNEST DUMMKOPF'S
            theatrical company are discovered, seated at several small
            tables, enjoying a repast in honour of the nuptials of LUDWIG,
            his leading comedian, and LISA, his soubrette.

                    LUD.  But the ceremony has not taken place.  We can't get a
              parson!
                    NOT.  Can't get a parson!  Why, how's that?  They're three
              a
              penny!
                    LUD.  Oh, it's the old story—the Grand Duke!
                    ALL.  Ugh!
                    LUD.  It seems that the little imp has selected this, our
              wedding day, for a convocation of all the clergy in the town to
              settle the details of his approaching marriage with the
              enormously wealthy Baroness von Krakenfeldt, and there won't be a
              parson to be had for love or money until six o'clock this
              evening!
                    LISA.  And as we produce our magnificent classical revival
              of Troilus and Cressida to-night at seven, we have no alternative
              but to eat our wedding breakfast before we've earned it.  So sit
              down, and make the best of it.
                    GRET.  Oh, I should like to pull his Grand Ducal ears for
              him, that I should!  He's the meanest, the cruellest, the most
              spiteful little ape in Christendom!
                    OLGA.  Well, we shall soon be freed from his tyranny.
              To-morrow the Despot is to be dethroned!
                    LUD.  Hush, rash girl!  You know not what you say.
                    OLGA.  Don't be absurd!  We're all in it—we're all tiled,
              here.
                    LUD. That has nothing to do with it.  Know ye not that in
              alluding to our conspiracy without having first given and
              received the secret sign, you are violating a fundamental
              principle of our Association?
